        <h2>Secret Identity: Bruce Wayne</h2>

        <img src="bruce.jfif" alt="bruce wayne" id="image" />

        <p>Batman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was
            created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger,[2][3] and first appeared in Detective Comics #27 in 1939.
            Originally named the "Bat-Man," the character is also referred to by such epithets as the Caped Crusader,
            the Dark Knight, and the World's Greatest Detective.[6]

            Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne
            Enterprises. Batman originated from an incident in Bruce's childhood; after witnessing the murder of his
            parents Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, he swore vengeance against criminals, an oath tempered by a sense
            of justice. Bruce trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight
            crime.[7]

            Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City with assistance from various supporting characters, including
            his butler Alfred, police commissioner Jim Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin. Unlike most
            superheroes, Batman does not possess any inhuman superpowers. He does, however, possess a genius-level
            intellect, is a peerless martial artist, and his vast wealth affords him an extraordinary arsenal of
            weaponry and equipment. A large assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues gallery, including his
            nemesis, the Joke</p>
